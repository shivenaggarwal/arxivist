# deep learning paper implementations
a structured implementation library of foundational deep learning research papers, categorized by application domain.

## what’s inside
- `activations/` – ReLU and friends
- `computer-vision/` – LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, YOLO, UNet, etc.
- `generative-models/` – GAN (for now)
- `sequence-modeling/` – RNN, LSTM
